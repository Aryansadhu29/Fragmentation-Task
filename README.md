# Fragmentation-Task
The code provided appears to contain multiple responsibilities within a single component, leading to decreased readability and maintainability. By fragmenting the code into smaller, more focused components, several benefits can be achieved:
1. Modularity: Each component becomes responsible for a specific aspect of the UI or functionality. This makes it easier to understand and reason about each piece of the application independently.
2. Reusability: Fragmenting the code allows for reuse of components in other parts of the application or even in different projects. For example, the BurnForm component could be reused in other pages where burn functionality is required.
3. Testability: Smaller components are generally easier to test because they have a clear and focused purpose. Unit tests can be written for each component in isolation, ensuring that they behave as expected.
4. Maintainability: With smaller components, it becomes easier to make changes and refactor code without affecting other parts of the application. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs and makes it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on the codebase.
5. Scalability: As the application grows, having a modular architecture makes it easier to add new features or make modifications without the codebase becoming overly complex.
